#FluffMates
##About
**An Ionic Mobile iOS App built with the [Petfinder API](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/api-key) and a Node.js/MongoDB backend.** The idea came from a conversation with a (lazy) friend of mine who wanted to adopt a cat, but didn't want to actually go to the shelter. 

FluffMates allows you to search for adoptable pets in your area, view their photos and bios, select your three favorites, and request them to be delivered to you. You choose the one you want, and send the other two back. Pet adoption, made simple! 

> (Note: this app will not actually send pets to you. I have not hired a fleet of pet deliverers.)

## Technologies Used:
* Ionic Mobile Framework
* Angular.js
* HTML/CSS
* Javascript/jQuery
* Petfinder API

See back end info [here](https://github.com/blairdow/fluffmates-api)

##Getting Started
See the app in action [here](https://fluffmates.herokuapp.com/)!

While it is designed and optimized for mobile, Fluffmates will work in any browser.

##Deployment
**To deploy this app locally:**

1. Download or fork this repo.

2. Install Ionic v1 via the command line and NPM by running ```npm install -g ionic``` in your Terminal (on Mac). This will install Ionic globally. You can also see their docs [here](http://ionicframework.com/docs/overview/).
3. Open the fluffmates folder in your Terminal and use ```ionic serve``` to run it. This will automatically open the app in your browser.

**To host your own version of this app:**

1. Download or fork this repo.

2. Deploy on hosting site of your choice! (I used [Heroku](www.heroku.com), along with [this tutorial](http://devdactic.com/deploying-ionic-to-heroku/). You should be good to go, as I already added the necessary files to deploy an Ionic app on Heroku.)

##Next Steps
###Features to add:
* Clickable links from "Saved Pets" list to view each pet's info
* Ability to friend other users and see their saved pets
* Add a button to email your list of saved pets to yourself or your friends
